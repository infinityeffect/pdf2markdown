Table 2 | We test DeepSeek- OCR's vision- text compression ratio using all English documents with 600- 1300 tokens from the Fox [21] benchmarks. Text tokens represent the number of tokens after tokenizing the ground truth text using DeepSeek- OCR's tokenizer. Vision Tokens=64 or 100 respectively represent the number of vision tokens output by DeepEncoder after resizing input images to 512x512 and 640x640.
